      <h1>Creating your own Training</h1>
    </header>
<main>
<h2>
  Have you ever wanted instead of just reading a book to attend a training on the topic
  and who better to present it than your quantum computing brain.  
  </h2>
 <h3>
   It's very simple to do, here's how;
  </h3> 

<p>Photo read a book several times with the intention of creating a training</p>
<p>Wait at least a day for your brain to process the book before hosting the training</p>
<p>Create the Teacher it can be anyone you want, favorite mentor, alien, animal, even another version of yourself</p>
<p>Create the Enviroment example; <br>Hotel Conference Room, <br>Nature like Jungle setting with monkeys, <br>Ocean view, <br>any enviroment you want.</p>
<p>Create the tools used in the training example 3d hologram projector, laser pointer, lights, cameras, etc.</p>
<p>Create participants like the other people at the training <br>Authorize participants to ask questions or not.</p>
<p>Set time and date, create Invitations if you want.</p>
<p>Remember this is your training, created from your imagination, the only limits are created by you</p>
<p>Enjoy your Training, time works differently in mental world, a one week training can be completed in minutes even seconds.</p>
<p>The more you do this the better you'll become</p>
