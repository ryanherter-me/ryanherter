        Writing what troubles you has a deep impact on how the situation is
        handled internally, I'm not sure of the details of how it all works, I
        just know it works and it works incredibly good. Your troubles seem to
        resolve themselves and then they just vanish into thin air, maybe it has
        something to do with admitting something isn't working. In my world most
        everything is automated, and by that I mean everything always takes care
        of itself, the only thing I have to do is initiate it, you you use this
        technique in your world too if you want, and tweek it so it works just
        the way you like it.
