        The Unconscious mind has access to everything, it can see the whole
        picture past, present, and future. Our conscious only sees a very small
        portion of the whole picture, I know we like to think we're always in
        control I mean it is your life right? How do I say this, everyone has a
        part to play, a set of tasks to accomplish and some people perfect those
        task, they become natural, automatic. I got kicked in the head,
        something in me came out and told me that I make all the wrong desicions
        in life and things would keep being fucked up if I kept making
        decisions, this aggressive being said surrender your wholeself to the
        unconscious every choice and decision everything, my entire life I was
        fucking making a mess of everything, and my life was I mean it wasn't
        that bad, but I knew if I wanted to achieve the goals that were lined up
        for me, I had to surrender my life to the Unconscious. And that is what
        I did and life has since then been on track and I have tons of goals and
        working towards achieving all my dreams. It's super nice because no
        stress my super computing unconscious now directs my life and I just
        play along, advancing thru life working through shit using the skills I
        leart along the way to help advance the levels of life. So thats my
        story about that, it's really a great life when all the hard work is
        automatically done for you.
