        Try is another word for fail, <a href="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/try" target="_blank">
        look at this site </a>as you can clearly see all of the example sentances lead to failing the task.
        So why does everyone use the stupid word, does everyone want you to fail.
        Do you think the great inventers like tesla tried to invent things or did he just do it. 
        People always hold on to the lies they've been taught, like they are the truths.
        Why do people do the things they do, parents say try this try that, maybe they don't know what try means,
        maybe the school system doesn't know what try means, maybe people are just stupid.
