This is an incomplete listing of the magical powers that exist in our world. There are so many different powers out there that trying to find out all of them is an impossible task. I have listed the most popular and well-known ones here. I make no guarantees as to the accuracy of any of the statements listed here. It is merely intended as a guide, not the rule for how these powers operate.

How to Gain Supernatural Powers
Many people out there ask if it is possible for a regular person to gain supernatural powers. Sadly, from what I have seen, you have to be born with these powers. While many people do not discover they have powers until they are teenagers or adults, I have yet to see anything about a regular person suddenly developing a supernatural power. There are a few on this list that can be learned with practice, but for the majority of these powers, you have to be born with the trait. There may very well be a way for one to gain supernatural powers in the future, but for now, those without powers will just have to live regular lives.

1. Aerona
An aerona is a person with the ability to see and understand all forms of illness, whether it is physical or mental. If someone is sensitive to the pain of those around them, then they have this power.

The other side of this power is that of biokinesis, which allows them to control organic tissue. This gives them the ability to heal themselves as well as others. They heal people by flushing out the illness and replacing it with healing energy.

The downside of this power is that some people can become so sensitive to the illness of others that it can make them sick as well. This normally wouldn't be a problem, but if one aerona heals another, it affects their energy causing them to lose their power and not be able to heal again.

This is a fairly common power, and many people that have this power become doctors, nurses, and counselors. They like to use their power to help others, and it is very easy for them to do so.

2. Aligist
Aligist is the term for someone who can understand all languages. This isn't as common as it seems like it should be. Some people are born with this gift while others work their entire lives to learn it. It is one of the few gifts that can be learned. Others can learn it with a little training from a true aligist.

There is no language an aligist cannot know. They are beyond all language barriers. Sometimes though they can be tricked if someone is speaking in code but after hearing a bit of the speech, they can decode it.

3. Astral Projection
Astral projection is the ability for one to project an astral body containing one's soul. This astral body can go anywhere in the world and go through walls. This power can be very useful for surveillance and other tasks that require a more covert approach.

Most people with this power discover they have it while sleeping as they will experience lucid dreams that then cross over into reality. They will be in their astral body floating over their normal body, and then they will realize that they have a special ability.

4. Breathe Underwater
The ability to breathe underwater is a fairly uncommon power. Especially considering not many people actually have the need to do it or are willing to try to see if they have it. This power is usually discovered by people who are drowning. They accidentally inhale water and discover they can breathe normally.

Afterward it is chalked up as a miracle but they decide to try it again, and that's when they truly discover what they can do. These people tend to become deep sea divers and lifeguards, other than that it seems to be a fairly useless power.


5. Clairvoyance
The power of clairvoyance is the ability to see the unknown. These people can sit in a room and know what is happening all around them in the world at that point in time. They do not see the past, or the future, merely the present. They usually only recognize feelings because the image is gone before they can concentrate on it long enough.

Sometimes they catch clips of someone's life and what they are doing at that time. They can catch car accidents and people in trouble. These people become troubled because they see all this trouble in the world but feel they are too far away to do any good. This is an uncommon power and is usually incorrectly titled as precognition.

6. Control Metal
The ability to control metal is especially useful for metalworkers and people directly connected to the elements of earth and metal. It is usually considered more of an elemental power though some people get it without being directly connected to the element. They are able to "speak" to the metal and cause it to change its shape or move in the direction they want. They also have the ability to locate metal that is hidden in the ground, which can be great for finding buried treasure.

7. Empath
An empath is someone who feels the emotions of another. This power is common in children who are already very perceptive of the world and people around them. Sometimes this power fades with age, but there are some people who manage to keep it their entire life. These people tend to become teachers and counselors because they have a strong desire to help others, but this is only good if they can control their power if the situation gets out of hand.

Most empaths have the tendency to spiral into depression from the overbearing negative emotions of others. These people need to learn to block the emotions of others so they can regain who they are and surround themselves with more positive people.

8. Energy Vampire
An energy vampire is a person who can use other people's powers as their own when they are in contact with that person.

A residual energy vampire, on the other hand, is someone who once they come in contact with a person with a power they will always be able to use this power. These people tend to become corrupted by that power. They turn to crime and attempting to make as many friends as possible in order to steal their powers. They usually quickly gain access to the thoughts of everyone around them, and it becomes difficult to keep secrets from them.

Energy vampires all have the ability to take a person's power and leave them weak, and near death, most try to avoid this as they like to keep their friends alive but it is a defense and energy vampire has to keep themselves safe.

9. Enhanced Hearing
Enhanced hearing is a fairly uncommon power. It allows a person to be able to hear things from very far away as though they are very close. The peculiar part about this power is that it doesn't affect the volume of the noise. The noises are merely heard as though they are very close instead of very far away.

10. Enhanced Memory
Some people have the power of enhanced memory. This power is not a common one but there are more people with this power now than there have been in the past. This is like an advanced form of a photographic memory. People with this power can read a book and will be able to recall that information whenever they want and they could quote it word for word if they felt the need. They can also remember events in great detail.

11. Enhanced Vision
The power of enhanced vision allows a person to be able to see things that are extremely small or extremely far away. This is helpful for those who make very small objects and need to do extremely fine work. It also helps if they must keep a lookout for something that is coming their way.


12. Fire
The power of fire is very self-explanatory. A person can create fire using their mind. Sometimes they must have the flame already there to work with, and some can create the flame itself. There are two main forms of this power that have been encountered, heat and illumination.

Heat fire is when a person can create balls of actual fire. They are generally a red-orange color. Some of these firestarters' flames will be tinted blue, green, or even purple, each depicting a certain part of their personality. These are the flames that cause fires and give severe burns except to those who have this power. This is a very dangerous power that has become more and more common in recent years. These people are also ruled by their emotions and tend to become very angry for no reason.
Illumination fire is when a person creates a ball of light energy instead of heat energy. These people don't respond to their emotions as much as those with heat fire. Their light is generally white or yellow in color, and less likely to contain other tints. These fireballs look a lot like the sun or a light bulb. Sometimes these people can start fires, but it doesn't happen often.

13. Ice
The power of ice is very simple. Those with this power are able to control the states of water even though it is called an ice power they can also evaporate, melt, or boil water, though the most impressive use is in turning liquids to ice. There must be moisture in the air for them to create ice out of nothing. If the air is very dry, they are rendered useless. These people tend to live in wet regions where they have full use of their power, and they tend to avoid dry places like deserts.

14. Illusionist
An illusionist is a person who can change the structure of molecules to make a location or person appear different. Sometimes this can be used to mask something that is already there or to create a distraction and lead someone the wrong way.

Some illusionists can create these illusions using their mind while others choose to use a more concrete method such as drawing or writing. These types of illusionists are more stable and less likely to get caught up in their illusions. All illusionists have very vivid imaginations and their dreams feel very real to them. They are usually committed to mental institutions because those around them worry about their safety.

15. Indestructibility
There is a power that allows the user to render their body indestructible. It is a very uncommon power that is similar to the power of regeneration. These people find that they cannot be hurt by any external forces, but if they wish to hurt themselves, they can. It is a power that is dependent entirely on one's mental state. Similar to regeneration these people often find themselves on both sides of the law.

16. Invisibility
People with the power of invisibility are able to make the molecules of their body transparent just by thinking about it, but more often than not it is triggered by emotions such as fear or anger. Sometimes people with this power can extend their power to objects touching them such as their clothes and if they concentrate very hard they can even extend it to other people or objects.

17. Levitation
Levitation is a fairly uncommon power that allows a person to raise their body above the ground, similar to flying but requiring much more concentration. People with this power try to keep a low profile and not use their power in public since they do not want to draw any unwanted attention to themselves.

18. Mind Control (Persuasion)
Mind control is also called the power of persuasion. It is the ability to influence the minds of those around you. Mind controllers cannot read the minds of those they influence; they can merely insert the thought and hope it is strong enough to be recognized and take hold. This is a very dangerous power because those who are being influenced often do not realize it and believe the thoughts to be their own. They are also compelled to believe those thoughts are right and will act on them without question.

19. Precognition
Precognition is the ability to see the future. Their visions are called premonitions. Many people have a small amount of this power and don't realize it. It is becoming more common in this changing world. These people are here to warn us of events to come so that our future will not be so quickly destroyed. These people sometimes believe themselves to be crazy when the things they see or dream end up coming true.

These people need to learn to control their power so they can use it when they need it instead of just waiting for a vision to come to them. Sometimes premonitions can be triggered but most of the time they cannot. They either reveal themselves while the bearer is sleeping or at moments when they are extremely relaxed, or extremely stressed.

20. Read Memories
The ability to read memories is a form of telepathy that only allows them to see the past of another. They can clearly see any event or series of events that the person experienced. This is a power that is commonly seen in police and therapists who are trying to figure out exactly what happened in a situation.

21. Regeneration
The power of regeneration allows the user to be able to heal themselves quickly. It is also extremely difficult for these people to die. The only way they can be killed is if their head is destroyed, so they don't have the mental ability to force their body to recover. This power is becoming less common due to modern medicine making it less necessary.

These people usually discover their powers after a failed suicide event or what would have been a fatal accident. They believe they should be dead but they see their body healing before their very eyes, and they realize what they are. They will then attempt every way to destroy themselves until they come to terms with the fact that they cannot die. After this point, they take one of two paths. They either will try to help others by going into dangerous situations, or they will become criminals because they know they can get away with whatever crime they have committed.

The downside of this power is that usually, the person will feel all of the pain associated with their injuries, but sometimes the people are too distraught to notice the pain and continue to harm themselves.

22. Remote Viewing
The power of remote viewing is unique because it requires a well-developed memory. It is essentially the same as a photographic memory, but the brain can track the items or people as they move throughout a room or area. This works until new elements are introduced, and the viewer must take a second look to be able to see everything clearly. It only takes one glance for the brain to register everything that is happening around them.

23. Retrocognition
Retrocognition is the ability to see things that happened in the past. It is believed that objects hold onto the energy around them and that energy remains until it is cleansed away by special ceremonies. These people are able to sense that energy and see what happened in a room or around certain objects.

These people become detectives and work with the police to help solve crimes. These people aren't common but they are able to recognize their power for what it is very easily and want to do everything they can to help other people. This is one of the easiest powers to control and it can also be learned by someone who is sensitive to energy fields.


24. See Spirits
The gift of seeing spirits is a power that is more common than most people realize. Many people have a tendency toward seeing those who have passed over. Sometimes these spirits are good and sometimes they are not nearly as good as we expect them to be.

Some mediums, as they tend to be called, have such a strong connection that they are often able to physically interact with these spirits, the results of which may be good or bad. These people tend to shy away or hide from their power because they are afraid of it. They don't want others to find out because they are afraid they are crazy and will be shunned by society. Some embrace their power and use it to help people from both sides of the wall.

25. See Through Walls
The ability to see through walls can also be considered X-Ray vision and it is a very difficult gift to master. Many people with this ability go through their lives never fully understanding the potential of what they can do. This power allows them to see through anything from walls, to boxes, to clothing.

It is difficult to focus on a particular layer and sometimes everything will become transparent and other times it will become so solid they cannot even see through glass or other things that are meant to be transparent. Everything around them is still physically solid but their molecules are rendered clear to the viewer only.


26. Shapeshifter
A shapeshifter is a person with the ability to change the shape and structure of their bodies into anything else they want. They can change themselves into another person, an animal, or even an inanimate object, though they can't stay in an inanimate form for very long.

Some shapeshifters choose to only change themselves into one other being and perfect that change while others like to change into many different things. Some shapeshifters closely identify with a certain animal and will choose to only change into that animal. That is where part of the werewolf myths come from, it was merely tribes of shapeshifters who idolized the wolf.

27. Speed
Speed is the power to move really fast. It is a rare power that is growing more and more common as those with power must run from those who wish to harm them. This power allows a person to run much faster than normal while not appearing to run that much faster. It is actually a bending of time that is created slowing down everyone else and making it appear as though you are moving much faster than everyone else. This power is very similar to the ability to stop time.

28. Stop Time
The ability to stop time is a complicated one. It is unclear exactly how many people have this power because they are unwilling to register themselves. These people are extremely paranoid and afraid of getting caught.

They are able to stop time and move about while it is stopped. These people are often confused with teleporters because they will disappear in one place and appear in another. These people have a tendency to fall into a life of crime and will steal from anybody and everybody in order to stay off the grid.

29. Super Strength
This is pretty self-explanatory but having enhanced strength gives you the ability to break and move objects that would normally be impossible for a typical human to do. Punching through walls, picking up cars, and throwing heavy objects long distances are all possible if you possess this power. However, these people are very good at concealing the fact that they are this strong so it would be nearly impossible to spot them in public unless they are using their super strength.

30. Telekinesis
Telekinesis is the ability to move things with your mind. This power is a fairly common one and one that can be learned though it is very difficult to do. It requires an understanding of energy that not many people care to learn. People with this power merely have to concentrate on an object and it will move without them touching it.

It takes a lot of practice to get an object to move where you want it to and stop there. These people spend their entire lives practicing and many never truly master this power. These people will often believe they are seeing things when they first discover their power. They will believe they are haunted and that "ghosts" are moving things around them.

31. Telepathy
The power of telepathy is a very common one, though not many people have it to its full extent. It is the power to read people's minds and know their thoughts and feelings. Many people have only a little bit of this power and can get the general feeling of what another is thinking.

Some people with this power must be touching another whom they are trying to read for their power to work, some merely have to be near the person. It seems that it is difficult to use this power with any sort of distance between people. Those who are skilled with this power can dig deeper and find things buried within a person's mind; others can only know what the person is presently thinking.

These people get overwhelmed when they are around others and tend to have constant headaches as they will catch bits and pieces of what people are thinking, especially if the people are thinking strongly.

32. Teleportation
Teleportation is a power that has been around for ages and is making a comeback in the number of people born with this power. Any person with this ability can essentially "think" themselves anywhere they want to go, be it across the room or across the world. This power only takes a short time to master, and it can be used for the rest of a person's life.

This power is more commonly found in people with birth defects, and it seems to be a form of evolution allowing them to be able to get around. Teleportation requires a strong mind and a willingness to accept danger. There is always a chance that the teleporter can end up in the wrong place and get trapped there. There have also been accounts of people using this power to travel through time. It's not known exactly how this power works, but it is believed that the mind breaks down the body molecules and sends it at the speed of light to wherever the person wants to go.

33. Time Travel
The ability to time travel is not very common. These people are a form of teleporter who have learned to move through time instead of space. This is a dangerous power because they are always in danger of changing something and causing themselves to cease to exist or trapping themselves in an alternate timeline that they cannot fix. Sometimes these people accidentally transport themselves to the future shortly before a large event, they then travel back to their own time to warn people and hopefully prevent the disaster.

34. Walk Through Walls
The ability to walk through walls an interesting one. The bearer of this power must move their molecules apart to fit through the cracks between the molecules of the wall or whatever object they are trying to walk through. There are very few solids these people cannot move through. These people tend to find themselves on both sides of the law even though they don't really like to be noticed and tend to stay to themselves. They are naturally paranoid about who will find them and what will happen to their power.

35. Weather Control
Weather control is a power that allows one to influence weather patterns. This power is generally unknown by the bearer until they hit puberty. It is a power that is very closely tied with the emotions. If a person with this power becomes angry, the weather will usually reflect this causing violent storms whether they want to or not.

This power is difficult to control, and it is hard for these people to ever learn to control their emotions well. These are the type of people who are most likely to want to get rid of their power. They find their lives very stressful, and it's hard for them to trust the people around them with knowledge about their power.

Magical Powers
Some individuals are born with the ability to use magic. This type of power is different from the ones I have talked about already. Using magic encompasses many different subcategories, so someone could be well-versed in many of these types of magic.

Types of Magical Powers
Necromancy: This magical power allows the user to communicate with the dead, and they can also summon spirits and other familiars. A necromancer can also resurrect the dead, so they can raise an army of undead warriors in no time at all. Most are not that powerful though as it takes a very skilled magic user to be capable of such feats.
Alchemy: Somone who practices alchemy can use magic to change matter into different forms, such as changing elements like lead into gold. An alchemist can manipulate all kinds of matter so they can become particularly powerful in just a short amount of time. Most like to keep a low profile as they do not want to be bothered by the government and other entities that want to use their power.
Dark Magic: A dark magic user has the ability to summon demons and other dark entities. They are capable of inflicting massive amounts of destruction on anyone if they so choose.
Spell Casting: Most magic users fall into this category as a spellcaster does just that: cast spells. These spells can vary from small to large though most do not have the magical skills to cast any serious spells.
