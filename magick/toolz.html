        Heat: is a kind of energy that is directly related to motion and
        vibration. All atoms are in motion all the time, and when you add heat
        to a substance, its atoms move around much more. More heat = more motion
        and all that extra motion means a greater likelyhood of atoms bumping
        into eachother and vibrating. If one were to physically manipulate the
        vibration of objects, you can heat things up (possibly to the point of
        ignition or explosion, which is called pyrokinesis), cool things down
        (possibly to the point of freezing, which is called cryokinesis) and
        indirectly use this force for subtle manipulations including things like
        helping plants grow and for healing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Light: is an important kind of energy that comes in discreet clumps
        called photons. Our visual sense has evolved to detect photons,
        particularly when they reflect off of other objects, which is how we
        see. Light is particularly special for us because photons are a bridge
        between mattter and energy. (photons have momentum,but no mass... they
        are almost, but not quite material!) Psychic forces that manipulate
        light can cause invisibility as well as the ability to convert matter to
        energy and vice versa, which is a requirement for teleportation and
        materialization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sound: is very important because it is another form of energy that we
        can directy inflence. Sound can be converted directly to electricity via
        something called the piezoelectric effect and directly into motion by
        way of resonant oscillation (making things vibrate.) It can also be
        converted into heat in the example of ultrasonic sound vibrating at a
        resonant frequency of water (kind of like how a microwave oven works) to
        create steam. Physically induced vibrations in air can cause sound,
        including disembodied voices and music and cause things to vibrate,
        possibly to the point of shattering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Electricity: is a force that comes from the flow of electrons. Electrons
        are one of the smallest "major" parts of the atom and are negatively
        charged. Psychic influence on electricity can manipulate electronic
        devices, weather, the nervous system of humans and animals (useful in
        self-defense, healing, human and animal telepathy) and indirectly, for
        telekinesis and levitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Magnetism: is a force we are all familiar with. Depending on the
        interplay of the positive and negative forces of magnetism, attractive
        or repulsive forces are generated. Contrary to popular belief, magnetism
        influences *everything* not just iron, although most other things are
        influenced so much less dramatically that you can't tell there is an
        influence at all. There are certain substances, like water, bismuth,
        graphite, which are "diamagnetic" - they are repulsed by magnetic
        fields. (Unfortunately the effects of diamagnetic are generally so weak
        they are not obvious,but have no fear! Pop out to the internet and
        search on "Diamagnetism experiments" and you'll find a number of easy
        experiments you can do for yourself.) The psychic influence of magnetism
        can manipulate electronic devices, influence animals, and work as a part
        of the forces responsible for telekinesis and levitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gravity: as a force in it's own right, it's manipulation in production
        of effects like telkinesis and levitation.<br />If gravity is just a
        shape in space it can be used for teleportation.
      </p>

        Thought: Ok, you might be thinking that I am going out on a limb here,
        but thought is a kind of energy, and an exceedingly important one at
        that... When you have a thought, a massive number of cell in your brain
        called neurons communicate with each other by flashing electrical
        impulses through the nerves, so at very least, thought has an electrical
        component. When electricity travels through wires it creates a magnetic
        field around the wire, and when electrical nerve impulses travel through
        your brain and body, they too can create fields. Some believe this may
        be part of what creates the "Aura" that surrounds the body of living
        things. (We will talk about that lots more a little later!) Thought
        Power is very subtle, but since we are working with subtle
        manipulations, it is an extremely importantform of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thought: thoughts are actual physical objects, complete with it's own
        electromagnetic field thought power is absolutely incredible, the
        creation of your world begins with thought
