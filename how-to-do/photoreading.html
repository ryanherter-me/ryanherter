    <h1>Super Fast Photo Reading</h1>

    <p>
      Reading has got to be one of my least favorite things to do, it just takes
      forever word by word thousands of pages boring stuff like chemistry,
      biology, patents, law, medical books, there are literally billions of
      pages of text and who can read them all?
    </p>
    <p>
      Photo Reading you say whats that?
    </p>
    <p>
      The world is upside down, opposite of the truth, reading is a job for
      super computers aka unconscious mind, stupid schools taught me the wrong
      way to do everything, reading for pleasure is one thing, but reading to be
      smarter, you need the right tools for the job.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this is how it's done, get adobe extention for chrome, download a pdf
      from pdfdrive or where ever you want, open it in your browser, tap/click
      the fit to page on the right hand side, tap/click rotate so the text is
      upside-down then click the screen and press and hold the spacebar, if you
      want it to flip pages faster or slower change the repeat rate on the
      keyboard in the settings. I like about 10 pages per second (30 pps), that
      way it doesn't take forever to read a book and you can still see every
      page, I find it flows very smooth. Keep your eyes open during the process
      or you'll miss out. If you need something to focus on keep your eyes on
      the address bar, that way the book is still in your visual field. If it's
      too much for you zoom out more so the pages are smaller. Thats it friends
      enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let your conscious mind relax and the supercomputer will process
      everything
    </p>

      Oh one other thing, the only limits in this world are the ones you create
      for your reality

      Here a <a href="/seconds-clock.html" target="_blank">seconds clock</a> to
      time how many PPS <br />Total pages divided by seconds equals PPS
